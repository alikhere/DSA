# DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I've tackled on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/alikhere/). Each solution includes efficient, well-commented code along with explanations for key concepts used in the solutions.

## Structure
- Each folder is organized by problem type (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.) to make navigation easy.
- Solutions are written in Python (or specify the language if different).
- Each solution includes test cases to verify correctness.

## About
